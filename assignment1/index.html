        I had a few seconds of loading before being surprised with the lovely
        theme of the website with its subtle pastel colour scheme. I love its
        choice of gradient colours and I was impressed by the interesting 3D
        models displayed on the website. As I realised the 3D models are the
        main subjects leading the primary style of this website as well, I was
        completely amazed and compelled to spend time experiencing more. Since
        it was 3D, I made sure I had the right choice of moving around and would
        not miss out anything by moving the cursor around to navigate the next
        move and get a sense of this digital space. I quickly sensed the
        movements and noticed that if I hovered around the 3D modeling subjects,
        the items on each subject slightly jumped up as a welcoming signal for
        me to click on them for further interaction.

          Firstly, I selected the menu on the upper right for my first
          navigation as I wanted to get familiar with the environment. The
          sidebar appeared with some sections for me to look through.
        </li>
        <li>
          After I roughly knew what this website offered in general, I went back
          to Homepage and hovered around.
        </li>
        <li>
          I randomly clicked on some 3D items as they were seemingly interactive
          and potentially built with intentions. Some of them stood still but
          then I was surprised and impressed when I clicked on the sofa item,
          the pen popped up and the laptop was closed. Similarly, I clicked on
          it again, and it closed.
        </li>
        <li>
          I kept moving the cursor and saw the 3D models slightly moving in
          space.
        </li>
        <li>
          I clicked on one of the subjects which led me to the Career page. I
          kept doing the same thing when I was moved to this new environment -
          hovering around and seeing the models bobbing back and forth. I
          expected the same interaction could happen and it did.
        </li>
        <li>
          I tried clicking on every single item of the subject alternately.
        </li>
