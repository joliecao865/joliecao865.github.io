            I had a few seconds of screen loading before being surprised with
            the lovely theme of the website with its subtle pastel gradient
            colour scheme. I was impressed by its interesting 3D elements
            displayed on the website.

          As I realised the 3D models are the main subjects leading the primary
          style of this website as well, I was completely amazed and compelled
          to spend time experiencing more. Since it was 3D, I made sure I had
          the right choice of moving around and would not miss out anything by
          moving the cursor around to navigate the next move and get a sense of
          this digital space. I quickly sensed the movements and noticed that if
          I hovered around the 3D modeling subjects, the items on each subject
          slightly jumped up as a welcoming signal for me to click on them for
          further interaction.

          Firstly, I selected the menu on the upper right for my first
          navigation as I wanted to get familiar with the environment. The
          sidebar appeared with some sections for me to look through. After I
          roughly knew what this website offered in general, I went back to
          Homepage and hovered around. I randomly clicked on some 3D items as
          they were seemingly interactive and potentially built with intentions.
          Some of them stood still but then I was surprised and impressed when I
          clicked on the sofa item, the pen popped up and the laptop was closed.
          Similarly, I clicked on it again, and it closed. I kept moving the
          cursor and saw the 3D models slightly moving in space. I clicked on
          one of the subjects which led me to the Career page. I kept doing the
          same thing as I did when I was moved to this new environment -
          hovering around and seeing the models bobbing back and forth. I
          clicked on 'Discover Career' button and it guided me to another page
          to read more information and view more images. Here I could scroll
          down and get informed.

            I found the 3D elements very captivating so I spent time clicking on
            them again and again to see their potential movements instead of
            much intention of seeing what was included as the purpose of the
            models.

          For example, there were five main subjects/models/stages on the
          Homepage, as I hovered around each of them, it popped up as a small
          interaction - the stage jumped up, a small ball and a coin slowly
          spinned in the air, or the sofa floated, etc. I was into exploring the
          features of all 3D models to see the implications and the design,
          because even the shades of the subjects were designed meticulously
          with moving interactions. Observing them also made me get the sense of
          the environment more as I scrolled down more and more. Since they
          integrated the 3D models with specific interactions, I enjoyed playing
          around with them. On the Omada page, I could actually throw the ball
          into the basket or shoot the ball into the goal and score some points.

          For example when I was redirected to the Luni Life page, there was a
          button with the colour of luminous green, which was the signal for me
          to definitely click on and be redirected to another page. There, I
          continued by clicking on the available photos to see what it offered
          and wanted to introduce. Hovering helped me see the subtle movements
          of the subjects.

          Question 5: What is your impression of the intended primary goal of
          the interactive experience?
        </h4>
        <p>
          As I experienced it, I found out the intended primary goal of the
          website is to create a playable interactive space to provide the
          introduction to Luni and hire employees. Its main aim is to welcome
          new talents to join them after exploring the presentation of their
          brand via entertaining design elements. Through the interactive
          experience, I got to know what Luni offers, learn about their new app
          product and working environment engagingly and originally.

          Question 6: How does the interactive experience communicate this
          primary goal?
        </h4>
        <p>
          The website offers a wide range of impressive interactions to go
          through all of the introductions about Luni. It has smooth and
          entertaining interactivity and simple navigation to explore all
          sections either in order or randomly. The space is full of creativity
          which represents well the purpose of their products and truly displays
          the goal of Luni as an app producing brand, specifically as an
          employer. The 3D elements welcome the users to its world and feel
          involved while navigating through. Moreover, it’s less in text to
          highlight one main big title, clear visuals and intentionally leads to
          another page for more text and further information, which avoids
          confusion and brings effective information consumption. The main
          purpose, hiring, is demonstrated on the homepage, which is placed on
          top and separated from other elements.

        </h4>
        <p>
          The website is designed for people who seek recruitment from Luni so
          they might need multiple visits. It offers updating status of career
          opportunities which is appealing for the employees to revisit and keep
          an eye on throughout the time to check for vacant positions or hiring
          locations. However, other information is fixed and can be explored in
          one visit. Saying that, the interactive experience is engaging and
          captivating enough to let people desire to navigate around once more
          when they come to the website again.

        <h4>
          Question 8: How does the interactive experience communicate how it
          should be interacted with over time?
        </h4>
        <p>
          On top of the website, there is specifically a statement of how many
          talents they are looking for, next to the menu bar. So before the
          users ever navigate through the site, they can quickly learn about the
          career opportunities. This would decide on the next users’ experience,
          either exit to revisit next time or keep exploring. The number of the
          talents they are seeking is displayed in another box colour, which
          manipulates people’s mind that this number would change now and then
          and encourages people to revisit to check for updates.

          Question 9: What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the

        </h4>
        <p>
          The playful 3D design elements as a main theme of the website reminded
          me of video games. The way I could directly interact with the elements
          made me feel like I was in a game and exploring the site as if I was
          going through game levels. When reading the main text, information
          about Luni, it evoked a sense of reading an online article with
          well-structured text in paragraphs and clear images and typography,
          which enhance the readability and engagement. As for specifically the
          Luni Life page, it might refer to Behance or other online portfolio
          sites to display art and products. It also reminded me of browsing an
          online shopping website where I need to go through every single
          product.

        <p>
          As for the interaction with 3D elements, they were so lively that I
          wanted to tap on them to see what might happen like playing games.
          Even clicking on the stages as if I was completing one level and going
          on the next one. To read the main information, I was more careful and
          spent more time going through rather than some quick interactions
          because it gave me a sense of reading articles. As for the sense of
          exploring online galleries/portfolio sites, the website encouraged me
          to linger over their products and project descriptions. It’s a way to
          learn about what they have done. It also made me choose what project I
          wanted to further explore based on the thumbnail picture and then
          browsed the website as if I was going through the categories when
          doing online shopping.

          The visual styles of game themes made me feel a sense of excitement,
          enhancing enjoyment. Then I slowed down and felt informed with the
          readings. As an expectation of a visually compelling space, the
          gallery-like page evoked feelings of inspiration and admiration while
          navigating through and it also made me feel more curious about what
          this space could offer. Along with the feeling of browsing shopping
          websites, it brought the feeling of engagement to explore the products
          with high-quality images and detailed descriptions.

        <p>
          The experience was mostly satisfying and worth the time as the website
          was designed in detail and had a gentle colour scheme to stay for a
          long while and explore. However, the longer I had the interaction, the
          more uncomfortable I got with it because the interaction was slow and
          had the effect of floating on everything. Even the scrolling down of
          the website would not be as smooth as I expected but having the sense
          of loading instead. It took time to move around the environment and
          required patience. Moreover, I scrolled down and waited for the
          slow-moving interaction with the hope of discovering a new section of
          the website but it only displayed the same as I could click on the top
          of the Homepage - which I have already done.

        <p>
          The most satisfying part of the interaction was the interaction with
          the details of the 3D modelling elements. I was amazed and impressed
          by how different and unexpected each item could respond to when I
          interacted with it. I liked the way it popped up and felt everything
          lively instead of merely the sense of hardware with eye-catching
          visuals. Moreover, the interactions were moderate which means they did
          not make me feel like missing something or overwhelmed because of too
          much. Not every subject has the movement so it was very enough. Some
          of the interactions were designed more in-depth with positive
          responses and realistic dynamism.
